[![npm: xkeys-webhid](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/xkeys-webhid.svg?label=npm:&nbsp;xkeys-webhid)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xkeys-webhid)

A Node.js module to interact with the [X-keys panels](https://xkeys.com/xkeys.html).

Licence: MIT

The project is based on the documentation available here: http://xkeys.com/PISupport/DeveloperHIDDataReports.php

## Demo

If you are using a [browser that supports WebHID](https://caniuse.com/webhid), you can try out the library right away, in the browser: [Demo](https://SuperFlyTV.github.io/xkeys/).

## Installation

### To use in Node.js

```bash
$ npm install --save xkeys
or
$ yarn add xkeys
```

### To use in browser

Uses WebHID, see list of supported browsers: [caniuse.com/webhid](https://caniuse.com/webhid).

```bash
$ npm install --save xkeys-webhid
or
$ yarn add xkeys-webhid
```

### Linux

On linux, the `udev` subsystem blocks access for non-root users to the X-keys without some special configuration. Save the following to `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-xkeys.rules` and reload the rules with `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`

```bash
SUBSYSTEM=="input", GROUP="input", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="05f3", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="05f3", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
```

Note: If you need more than 4 panels connected simultaneously, you might also have to set your env-var [UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/threadpool.html):

```javascript
var { env } = require('process')
env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 8 // Allow up to 8 panels
```

## BREAKING CHANGES

Please note that version `2.0.0` is a _BREAKING CHANGE_, as most of the API have changed.
If you're upgrading from `<2.0.0`, please read the [_Migrations_](#Migrations) section below.

## Getting started - Node.js

_[See examples folder for more examples.](./packages/node/examples/)_

### Watch for connected X-keys (recommended)

This is the recommended way to use this library, to automatically be connected or reconnected to the panel.

_Note: The watcher depends on the [node-usb](https://github.com/node-usb/node-usb) library, which might be unsupported on some platforms._

```javascript
const { XKeysWatcher } = require('xkeys') // or 'xkeys-webhid' in a browser

/*
	This example connects to any connected x-keys panels and logs
	whenever a button is pressed or analog thing is moved
*/

// Set up the watcher for xkeys:
const watcher = new XKeysWatcher({
	// automaticUnitIdMode: false
	// usePolling: false
	// pollingInterval= 1000
})
watcher.on('error', (e) => {
	console.log('Error in XKeysWatcher', e)
})

watcher.on('connected', (xkeysPanel) => {
	console.log(`X-keys panel of type ${xkeysPanel.info.name} connected`)

	xkeysPanel.on('disconnected', () => {
		console.log(`X-keys panel of type ${xkeysPanel.info.name} was disconnected`)
		// Clean up stuff
		xkeysPanel.removeAllListeners()
	})
	xkeysPanel.on('error', (...errs) => {
		console.log('X-keys error:', ...errs)
	})

	// Listen to pressed buttons:
	xkeysPanel.on('down', (keyIndex, metadata) => {
		console.log('Button pressed ', keyIndex, metadata)

		// Light up a button when pressed:
		xkeysPanel.setBacklight(keyIndex, 'red')
	})
	// Listen to released buttons:
	xkeysPanel.on('up', (keyIndex, metadata) => {
		console.log('Button released', keyIndex, metadata)

		// Turn off button light when released:
		xkeysPanel.setBacklight(keyIndex, false)
	})

	// Listen to jog wheel changes:
	xkeysPanel.on('jog', (index, deltaPos, metadata) => {
		console.log(`Jog ${index} position has changed`, deltaPos, metadata)
	})
	// Listen to shuttle changes:
	xkeysPanel.on('shuttle', (index, shuttlePos, metadata) => {
		console.log(`Shuttle ${index} position has changed`, shuttlePos, metadata)
	})
	// Listen to joystick changes:

	xkeysPanel.on('joystick', (index, position, metadata) => {
		console.log(`Joystick ${index} position has changed`, position, metadata) // {x, y, z}
	})
	// Listen to t-bar changes:
	xkeysPanel.on('tbar', (index, position, metadata) => {
		console.log(`T-bar ${index} position has changed`, position, metadata)
	})
})

// To stop watching, call
// watcher.stop().catch(console.error)
```

### Connect to a devices manually

```javascript
const { setupXkeysPanel } = require('xkeys')

/*
	This example shows how to use XKeys.setupXkeysPanel()
	directly, instead of going via XKeysWatcher()
*/

// Connect to an xkeys-panel:
setupXkeysPanel()
	.then((xkeysPanel) => {
		xkeysPanel.on('disconnected', () => {
			console.log(`X-keys panel of type ${xkeysPanel.info.name} was disconnected`)
			// Clean up stuff
			xkeysPanel.removeAllListeners()
		})
		xkeysPanel.on('error', (...errs) => {
			console.log('X-keys error:', ...errs)
		})

		xkeysPanel.on('down', (keyIndex, metadata) => {
			console.log('Button pressed', keyIndex, metadata)
		})

		// ...
	})
	.catch(console.log) // Handle error
```

or

```javascript
const { listAllConnectedPanels, setupXkeysPanel } = require('xkeys')

// List and connect to all xkeys-panels:
listAllConnectedPanels().forEach((connectedPanel) => {
	setupXkeysPanel(connectedPanel)
		.then((xkeysPanel) => {
			console.log(`Connected to ${xkeysPanel.info.name}`)

			// ...
		})
		.catch(console.log) // Handle error
```

## Getting started - Browser (WebHID)

See the example implementation at [packages/webhid-demo](packages/webhid-demo).

```javascript
const { XKeysWatcher, requestXkeysPanels } = require('xkeys-webhid')

const watcher = new XKeysWatcher({})
watcher.on('error', (e) => {
	console.log('Error in XKeysWatcher', e)
})
watcher.on('connected', (xkeysPanel) => {
	// This will be triggered whenever a panel is connected, or permissions is granted.
	// >> See the example above for setting up the xkeysPanel <<
})

myHTMLButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
	// Open the Request device permissions dialog:
	requestXkeysPanels().catch((error) => console.error(error))

	// Notes:
	// When the user has granted permissions, the browser will remember this between sessions.
	// However, if the panel is disconnected and reconnected, the user will have to grant permissions again.
})
```

### Demo

If you are using a Chromium v89+ based browser, you can try out the [webhid demo](https://SuperFlyTV.github.io/xkeys/).

## API documentation

### XKeysWatcher

The XKeysWatcher has a few different options that can be set upon initialization:

```javascript
const { XKeysWatcher } = require('xkeys')
const watcher = new XKeysWatcher({
	// automaticUnitIdMode: false
	// usePolling: false
	// pollingInterval= 1000
})
watcher.on('error', (e) => {
	console.log('Error in XKeysWatcher', e)
})
watcher.on('connected', (xkeysPanel) => {
	// xkeysPanel connected...
})
// Note: In a browser, user must first grant permissions to access the X-keys, using requestXkeysPanels().
```

#### automaticUnitIdMode

When this is set to `true`, the XKeysWatcher will enable the `"reconnected"` event for the xkeysPanels.

By default, there is no unique identifier stored on the X-keys panel that can be used to differ between
"reconnecting a previously known panel" or "connecting a new panel".
The `automaticUnitIdMode` fixes this by writing a pseudo-unique id to the `unitId` of the panel,
if none has been set previously.

#### usePolling

When this is set, the XKeysWatcher will not use the `usb` library for detecting connected panels,
but instead resort to polling at an interval (`pollingInterval`).
This is compatible with more systems and OS:es, but might result in slower detection of new panels.

### xkeysPanel Events

```javascript
// Example:
xkeysPanel.on('down', (keyIndex, metadata) => {
	console.log('Button pressed', keyIndex, metadata)
})
```

| Event            | Description                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"error"`        | Triggered on error. Emitted with `(error)`.                                                                     |
| `"down"`, `"up"` | Triggered when a button is pressed/released. Emitted with `(keyIndex, metadata)`.                               |
| `"jog"`          | Triggered when the jog wheel is moved. Emitted with `(index, jogValue, metadata)`                               |
| `"shuttle"`      | Triggered when the shuttle is moved. Emitted with `(index, shuttleValue, metadata)`                             |
| `"joystick"`     | Triggered when the joystick is moved. Emitted with `(index, {x, y, z, deltaZ})`                                 |
| `"tbar"`         | Triggered when the T-bar is moved. Emitted with `(index, tbarPosition, metadata)`                               |
| `"disconnected"` | Triggered when panel is disconnected.                                                                           |
| `"reconnected"`  | Triggered when panel is reconnection. Only emitted when [automaticUnitIdMode](#automaticUnitIdMode) is enabled. |

### xkeysPanel Methods

**Setting the backlight of a button**

```javascript
xkeysPanel.setBacklight(keyIndex, color)

// Examples:
// Set blue light
xkeysPanel.setBacklight(keyIndex, '0000ff')
// Set any available default light
xkeysPanel.setBacklight(keyIndex, true)
// Turn off light
xkeysPanel.setBacklight(keyIndex, false)
// Set flashing light
xkeysPanel.setBacklight(keyIndex, 'red', true)

// Set color (for RGB-supported devices)
xkeysPanel.setBacklight(keyIndex, 'ff3300')
```

**Set the indicator LEDs (the red/green status LED's)**

```javascript
xkeysPanel.setIndicatorLED(ledIndex, on, flashing)

// Examples:
// Light up the green LED
xkeysPanel.setIndicatorLED(1, true)
// Flash the red LED
xkeysPanel.setIndicatorLED(2, true, true)
```

**Set backlight intensity**

```javascript
xkeysPanel.setBacklightIntensity(intensity)

// Example:
// Set max intensity
xkeysPanel.setBacklightIntensity(255)
```

**Set all backlights on or off**

```javascript
xkeysPanel.setAllBacklights(color)

// Example:
// Light up all buttons
xkeysPanel.setAllBacklights(true)
// Light up all buttons in a nice color
xkeysPanel.setAllBacklights('ff33ff')
// Turn of all buttons
xkeysPanel.setAllBacklights(false)
```

**Set flashing frequency**

```javascript
// The frequency can be set to 1-255, where 1 is fastest and 255 is the slowest.
// 255 is approximately 4 seconds between flashes.
xkeysPanel.setFrequency(frequency)

// Example:
// Set the frequency to a pretty fast flash
xkeysPanel.setFrequency(8)
```

** Set unit ID **

```javascript
// Sets the UID (unit Id) value in the X-keys hardware
// Note: This writes to the EEPROM, don't call this function too often, or you'll kill the EEPROM! (An EEPROM only support a few thousands of write operations.)
xkeysPanel.setUnitId(unitId)
```

** Save backlights **

```javascript
// Save the backlights (so they are restored to this after a power cycle).
// Note: This writes to the EEPROM, don't call this function too often, or you'll kill the EEPROM! (An EEPROM only support a few thousands of write operations.)
xkeysPanel.saveBackLights()
```

#### Other functionality

See [the XKeys-class](packages/core/src/xkeys.ts) for more functionality.

### Supported devices

Thanks to official support from [P.I Enginneering, the X-keys manufacturer](https://xkeys.com/), there is support for all official (and some experimental) devices.

See the full list in [products.ts](packages/core/src/products.ts).

### 2.1.1

Version `2.1.1` has a minor change for when stopping the XKeysWatcher instance:

```javascript
const watcher = new XKeysWatcher()
await watcher.stop() // Now returns a promise
```

# For developers

This is a mono-repo, using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

### Setting up your local environment

This repo is using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). If you don't want to use it, replace `yarn xyz` with `npm run xyz` below.

To install Yarn, just run `npm install -g yarn`.

### Setting up the repo

- Clone the repo and `cd` into it.
- Install all dependencies: `yarn`.
- Do an initial build: `yarn build`

### Running and testing local changes

If you'd like to run and test your local changes, `yarn link` is a useful tool to symlink your local `xkeys` dependency into your test repo.

```bash
# To set up the xkeys-repo for linking:
cd your/xkeys/repo
yarn lerna exec yarn link # This runs "yarn link" in all of the mono-repo packages
yarn build

# Every time after you've made any changes to the xkeys-repo you need to rebuild
cd your/xkeys/repo
yarn build

# Set up your local test repo to used the linked xkeys libraries:
cd your/test/repo
yarn add xkeys
yarn link xkeys
yarn link @xkeys-lib/core

# To unlink the xkeys-lib from your local test repo:
cd your/test/repo
yarn unlink xkeys
yarn unlink @xkeys-lib/core
yarn --force # So that it reinstalls the ordinary dependencies
```

### Contribution guidelines

If you have any questions or want to report a bug, [please open an issue at Github](https://github.com/SuperFlyTV/xkeys/issues/new).

If you want to contribute a bug fix or improvement, we'd happily accept Pull Requests.
(If you're planning something big, [please open an issue](https://github.com/SuperFlyTV/xkeys/issues/new) to announce it first, and spark discussions.

### Coding style and tests

Please follow the same coding style as the rest of the repository as you type. :)

Before committing your code to git, be sure to run these commands:

```bash
yarn # To ensure the right dependencies are installed
yarn build # To ensure that there are no syntax or build errors
yarn lint # To ensure that the formatting follows the right rules
yarn test # To ensure that your code passes the unit tests.
```

If you're adding a new functionality, adding unit tests for it is much appreciated.
